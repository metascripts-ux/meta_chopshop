## Installation

1. Download the resource
2. Place it in your server's resources folder
3. Add the following to your server.cfg:
```cfg
ensure meta_chopshop
```

## Configuration

The resource is highly configurable through the `config.lua` file:

### Framework Settings
```lua
Config.Framework = 'qb' -- 'qb', 'qbx', or 'esx'
Config.MenuType = 'ox_lib' -- 'qb-menu' or 'ox_lib'
Config.TargetSystem = 'ox_target' -- 'qb-target' or 'ox_target'
```

### Blip Configuration
```lua
Config.Blips = {
    enabled = true,
    chopShop = {
        enabled = true,
        sprite = 446,
        color = 1,
        scale = 0.7,
        label = "Chop Shop"
    },
    partBuyer = {
        enabled = true,
        sprite = 446,
        color = 2,
        scale = 0.7,
        label = "Part Buyer"
    }
}
```

### Material Exchange
```lua
Config.MaterialExchange = {
    enabled = true,
    materials = {
        {
            name = "metalscrap",
            label = "Metal Scrap",
            ratio = 2,
            maxAmount = 25,
            price = {min = 25, max = 50}
        }
        -- Add more materials as needed
    }
}
```
